# JavaQR
## A getting-started guide to beginner Java.
This pre-made site is to help a beginner learn the very *basics* of programming in Java.
It was created to compete in a competition at Woodside High School.

It uses **Bootstrap** for its template and many of the styles, with some modifications from yours truly. This was mostly to save time by filling in gaps in my knowledge, and was within the rules of the competition.

## -Live version-

The live version can be found [on github.io](https://christop406.github.io/javaqr).
